Php library that provides implementations for __gdbots:iam__ schemas.   Using this library assumes that you've already created and compiled your own pbj classes using the [Pbjc](https://github.com/gdbots/pbjc-php) and are making use of the __"gdbots:iam:mixin:*"__ mixins from [gdbots/schemas](https://github.com/gdbots/schemas).

> If your project is using Symfony use the [gdbots/iam-bundle-php](https://github.com/gdbots/iam-bundle-php) to simplify the integration.
